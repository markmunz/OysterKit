     Creates an iterable stream of tokens using the supplied source and this `Grammar`
     
     It is very easy to create and iterate through a stream, for example:
     
         let source = "12+3+10"
     
         for token in try calculationGrammar.stream(source){

         }
     
     Streams are the easiest way to use a `Grammar`, and consume less memory and are in general faster
     (they certainly will never be slower). However you cannot easily navigate and reason about the
     stream, and only top level rules and tokens will be created.

     Creates a `HomogenousTree` using the supplied grammar.
     
     A `HomogenousTree` captures the result of parsing hierarchically making it
     easy to manipulate the resultant data-structure. It is also possible to get
     more information about any parsing errors. For example:
     
         let source = "12+3+10"
     
         do {
            // Build the HomogenousTree

            print(ast)
         } catch let error as ProcessingError {
            print(error.debugDescription)
         }

     Builds the supplied source into a Heterogeneous representation (any Swift `Decodable` type).
     
     This is the most powerful application of a `Grammar` and leverages Swift's `Decoable` protocol.
     It is strongly recommended that you [read a little about that first](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types).
     
     Essentially each token in the grammar will be mapped to a `CodingKey`. You should first parse into a `HomogenousTree`
     to make sure your types and the hierarchy generated from your grammar align.
    
     If you want to automatically generate the `Decodable` types you can do this using [STLR](https://github.com/SwiftStudies/OysterKit/blob/master/Documentation/STLR.md)
     and [`stlrc`](https://github.com/SwiftStudies/OysterKit/blob/master/Documentation/stlr-toolc.md) which will automatically synthesize your grammar and data-structures in Swift.
