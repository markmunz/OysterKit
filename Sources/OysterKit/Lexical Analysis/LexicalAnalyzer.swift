/**
 The job of an implementation of this protocol is two fold
 
  * Manage the state of the `Scanner` to provide n lookahead capability to the surrounding rules
  * To provide a layer of abstraction between consumers of scanning behaviour and the scanner itself. This allows the scanner to be
    as simple as possible
 
 It used heavily during `Rule` evaluation. Typically a rule will start by `mark()`ing it's possition (remembering the positiong of the `Scanner` at
 the start of rule evaluation. During `Rule` evaluation rules will result (eventually) in calls to the various `scan` methods which will advance
 the Scanner. Finally, the rule will either be satisfied and `proceed()->LexicalContext` will be called, or fail and `rewind()` will be called returning
 the `Scanner` to its state before `mark()` was called.
