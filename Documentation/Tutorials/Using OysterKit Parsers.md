# Using OysterKit Parsers

This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the new API for streaming and parsing in [OysterKit 0.2](https://github.com/SwiftStudies/OysterKit/releases/tag/0.2.0). It does not cover the legacy API as that will be removed (deprecated in 0.2.0) in a future release. 

I'll cover the major lexical analysis and parsing use cases with some concrete examples.
