# Contributing to OysterKit

There are a number of contributions that can be made at this stage, and all issues & pull requests are welcome. 

## Thoughts

If you only ever intend to be a consumer of OysterKit then any thoughts, for example on the API provided, it's functionality or implementation patters, the STLR language, or indeed anything about the project, please just create an issue and we can start a discussion. 

## Documentation

The documentation here is at a very early stage and examples, any kind of correction, or just questions that the documentation doesn't address... please just create an issue. 

## Source Code Documentation

Very few comments, this needs to be done. 

## Tests

Coverage of the automated unit tests are quite good, but more thorough exploration of all different rule patters is required. New tests always welcome. 

In particular the performance tests need fixing up. 

### Linux

Although this package only requires Foundation, I have not yet set-up the XCTests to run on Linux, this needs to be done (just the array of testMethods needs to be added to each class). A good starter issue!
